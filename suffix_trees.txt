suffix trees (liner time):
- longest substring in string (the deepest node)
- longest common substring of 2 strings (LCA of two nodes)
- number of times substring occure in string (follow the path and see how many childs the node have)
- longest common subsequence of two strings (concat the strings, get the deepest one who contains the two strings)

KMP:
  - liner time finding substring in string (substring search)
